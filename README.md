This is a plugin that allows you to bookmark your favorite layers.  
You can bookmark components you see frequently and find them quickly.

## usage

Select the component and click the plus button.  
You can change the order by dragging.  
Use the directional keys to toggle the selection.  
You can change the name, and even delete it.  
This is similar to Figma's operation.  
Bookmarks are managed on a project-by-project basis.

Data cannot be shared between the browser version and the desktop version.
